Inspired after discovering that many rape investigations stalled for lack of funds to analyze evidence, Rep. Victoria Neave spearheaded an initiative to tackle this problem, NPR reports. The Dallas Democrat introduced a bill encouraging Texans to donate $1 or more at the DMV when renewing or applying for driver's licenses. Similar to donations for veterans and other causes, these contributions would fund the testing of DNA evidence from reported rapes, including semen, hair, and fibers. If passed, the bill—which has cleared the House and awaits a Senate vote—could generate around $1 million annually and potentially eliminate the backlog of untested rape kits. Given that testing a single rape kit can cost up to $2,000, according to NPR, many police departments in Texas and beyond struggle with the financial burden. In a March interview with the New York Times, Neave emphasized the importance of properly testing physical evidence for women who bravely report rape, saying, \"we owe it to them\" to ensure thorough investigations. Estimates suggest there are around 20,000 untested kits in Texas, as reported by the Daily Beast last month. However, this crowdfunding proposal has faced criticism. Victims' advocate Kristen Lenau describes it as \"horrifying\" that testing rape kit evidence depends on public donations, arguing that state and local governments should bear this responsibility. (For some victims, securing a rape kit has been a significant challenge.) It is crucial that the article exceeds 2000 words in length."}

Roran lay cozily on the floor with a blanket and pillow as his mother read him fairytales. Her voice, soft and warm like the fire, enveloped Roran in a comforting embrace. He cherished nights like these, listening to his mother’s stories and the scratching of his father’s quill. Often, the three of them spent their evenings in this room before Roran was sent to bed.\n\nRoran was the only child of King Daris and Queen Jaelin. Although they wished for more children, mysterious reasons prevented it. Thus, they showered him with all their love, and he was content. Even at four years old, he understood how deeply they loved him, and he returned their affection. Despite their royal duties, the King and Queen spent as much time with him as possible.\n\nBut tonight took an unexpected turn. The library door burst open, and Mage Kevala stood in the doorway, her face shocked.\n\n“Your Majesties!”\n\n“What’s the meaning of this interruption at this hour, Kevala?” King Daris, rising from his desk, sounded angry.\n\nRoran sat up, noticing something odd: Kevala, usually so composed, looked like she might cry. His fear growing, he ran to his mother, who lifted him onto her lap, hugging him tightly.\n\n“It’s Greschel.”\n\nThe King’s anger vanished. “Greschel? What’s happened?”\n\nKevala held out a folded parchment, and Roran’s curiosity momentarily overcame his fear. He pulled away slightly from his mother’s embrace to watch as the King took the parchment. Even in the fire’s dim light, Roran could see the color drain from his father’s face.\n\n“Greschel is… dead!”\n\n“What?” The Queen’s arms loosened around Roran, shock on her face.\n\nRoran’s father turned, grief-stricken. “He traveled north alone before his company was ready. He got sick and died before the healer could reach him. How could this happen?”\n\nSilence filled the room. Greschel, the High Mage of Ascai and their advisor, was gone. Though Roran didn’t know Greschel well, their few encounters had been intimidating. Greschel’s constant scowl unnerved him, and he always felt the mage’s disapproval.\n\nBut Roran knew his parents had valued Greschel, and their sorrow was palpable.\n\nRoran glanced at Kevala, who met his gaze with fearful eyes. As the King walked back to the Queen, Kevala seemed about to speak but hesitated, her eyes lingering on Roran. Unsettled by her frightened look, Roran squirmed in his mother’s lap, a new anxiety rising within him. Turning back to his mother, he saw silent tears streaming down her cheeks. He leaned into her, letting her wrap her arms around him as she cried."}

Page is bent on getting Willoughby to participate in a major fishing tournament, only to find out that he's a fraud—he's never actually fished.
