Please provide a detailed evaluation of an AI assistant's response to a user's request on long text generation, using the following six dimensions with scores ranging from 1 to 10, with 10 meaning the response best fits the critiria and 1 meaning it is the worst fit:

Consistency: The response maintains a consistent tone and style throughout.

Clarity: The response is clear and easily understood with concise and precise language.

Please evaluate the quality of the following response to the user request based on the above criterion.

<User Request>

{query}

</User Request>

<Response>

{response}

</Response>

You do not have to take into account if the response meets the user's length requirements when evaluating it. When providing your evaluation, please first include a brief analysis of the quality of the AI assistant's response and then score it in each dimension. Your response must strictly follow the JSON format: {{"Analysis": ..., "Relevance": ..., "Coherence": ..., "Accuracy": ..., "Consistency": ..., "Clarity": ..., "Creativity": ..., "Engagement": ...}}. Each score should be an integer between 1 and 10. You should be able to demonstrate differentiation and be as strict as possible. Do not output any other information except the JSON response.
